TextLog is a minimalist, distraction-free and content-focused Jekyll theme. TextLog uses [Droid Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans) typeface from Google Web Fonts. TextLog also supports [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) and [tags](https://heiswayi.github.io/textlog/tagged/)

TextLog post layout contains following structures:

- the post title
- the post metadata such as date, author name and clickable post tags
- the post content
- [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) if enabled

TextLog is responsive and mobile-friendly.
